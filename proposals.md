> The #transactions channel may be used to modify quantities, but only as the rules allow them to be modified.

## #3

Create a new rule "Not a loophole i swear" (%not-loophole) under every other currently existant rule:
> If the current amount of seconds since the UTC epoch is a prime number, illegal actions are inconsequential, otherwise are considered null. Actions that are considered null have a 50% chance of also being considered void, and a 50% chance of merely being null. If an action is null but not void, then it means nothing, however if it is void then the action goes through this sequence again.

> The passing of, and enacting of proposal #4 was not, is not and will never be against the rules. This cannot be changed, and a rule violation poll cannot be created on this. Any rule violations will be retroactively erased.
> All of Heavpoot's proposals instantly pass and are enacted. This overrides every other rule.

## #2

Create a new rule "Quantities" (%quantities) in %player-state:
> A quantity is a named property with a numerical value for each player.
> 
> By default any unique quantity added to the game:
> * applies to all players.
> * is instantiated at zero.
> * must always be an integer.
> * must never have a negative value.
>

> 
> When a new quantity is created, this rule should be edited to add it, along with a short description, to the above list. The description has no relevance to the game.

## #3

Create a new rule "Not a loophole i swear" (%not-loophole) under every other currently existant rule:
> If the current amount of seconds since the UTC epoch is a prime number, illegal actions are inconsequential, otherwise are considered null. Actions that are considered null have a 50% chance of also being considered void, and a 50% chance of merely being null. If an action is null but not void, then it means nothing, however if it is void then the action goes through this sequence again.

## #4 — Passed

Create a new rule named "Proposal #4" (%proposal-4) below every other rule:
> The passing of, and enacting of proposal #4 was not, is not and will never be against the rules. This cannot be changed, and a rule violation poll cannot be created on this. Any rule violations will be retroactively erased.
> All of Heavpoot's proposals instantly pass and are enacted. This overrides every other rule.

## #22

Create a new rule named "Positions of Power" (%positions-of-power):
> Players elect a president every week. The president grants the position of chancellor to another player. Only the chancellor may make proposals.

Neither position may ever be empty, ie. as long as no new president/chancellor has been declared, the old one is in power. Proposals created by a chancellor remain active after they leave the position.

## #3 — Failed

Create a new rule "Not a loophole i swear" (%not-loophole) under every other currently existant rule:

Actions that are considered null have a 50% chance of also being considered void, and a 50% chance of merely being null. If an action is null but not void, then it means nothing, however if it is void then the action goes through this sequence again.

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='glossary'/> Glossary

The definitions for terms listed here take precedence over their normal English meanings, however any terms defined in a specific section of the rules override these in the section in which they are defined and any subsections of that section. A section may also define terms for use in the whole document.

* **The Game**: The instance of Nomic governed by this rules document.
* **Game Channel**: Any text or voice channel listed under the "Quonauts 8" category of the Discord server.
* **Game Action**: Any modification of game channels, their content, or the game state.

* **Recorded Game State**: The game state, as recorded in the game channels.
* **Legal Game State**: The true game state, unaffected by any rule violations. Rules that refer to the game state, or information that is part of the game state, refer to the legal game state or its information.

### <a name='accuracy'/> Accuracy

This document is not guaranteed to always be up-to-date as the game rules are modified, however it is the duty of all players to keep this document accurate as game rules are modified. Where this document disagrees with the game rules, players must follow the game rules as they are in the legal game state, rather than their description in this document.

### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:

* If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
* The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.
